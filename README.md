## Introduction

`Rocketry` is an iOS application designed with Apple's `WidgetKit` and `SwiftUI` frameworks. We eliminate the need to open an app for detailed information on an upcoming launch by utilizing the various wigets compatible with the iOS lockscreen, home screen, and watchOS.

## Resources

- [**Launch Library 2**](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/docs/) API documentation for fetching spaceflight events.
- [**Launch List**](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/) endpoint that returns all Launch objects or a single launch.
